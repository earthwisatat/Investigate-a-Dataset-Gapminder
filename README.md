# Investigate-a-Dataset-Gapminder-Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
Project - Investigate a Datasets

# Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to make my analysis easier.

This project is an analysis of dataset that can be obtained from Gapminder World. It will explore about cellphones, cellphones per 100 people, population, Income (per person) and urban population (percent of total). It will also look at these variables to find trends, which variable are related to the cellphones.

These are the names and decriptions of the key variables in this report.

* "cellphone". Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions
* "cellphone_per_100_people". Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 people
* "population". Number of population in each country
* "income_per_person". Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 prices PPP based on 2011 ICP)
* "urban_population%". Urban population refers to people living in ueban areas as defined by national statistical offices.

# What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* csv

# What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use.
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis.
- Be familiar with Python libraries like Numpy and Pandas, which let accessing your data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualizing the data that your findings.

# Project details 

## Introduction
* Provides a motivation for investigating and analyzing the datasets covering data across Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions, Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 people, Number of population in each country, Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power and Urban population refers to people living in ueban areas as defined by national statistical offices.
* Categorizes the investigation and analysis into separate sections.
* Provides the indicator name of all raw datasets used in each section.
* Introduces the main questions for each section which will be investigated through the following analyses.

## Data Wrangling
* Identifies several general properties of the raw datasets in each section.
* Builds on these general properties to define and execute the operations for cleaning the raw datasets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
* Applies data visualization and descriptive statistics to analyze the cleaned datasets and derive insights.

## Conclusions
* Create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting.
